# Facial Key-points Detection & Recognition

Detection and recognition of Human Faces in context of group-video conferencing, recording meetings, class-activities. Used for the purpose of automating the attendance process. 

## Overview

This repository contains:

- Face dectection via [Viola-Jones](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework) and [HOG](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients).
- Face representation learning using pre-trained [Openface](http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/) models.
- Face recognition and clustering using [DBSCAN](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DBSCAN).
- t-SNE visualization of face representation vectors.

## Usage

Refer to [code](code/) for individual usage.
